## Overview
Realtime Digital Filter Design is an interactive desktop application that allows users to design and visualize digital filters through zero-pole placement on the z-plane. The application supports various customization options, real-time signal processing, and filter realization, making it an invaluable tool for engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts in signal processing.

## Features

### üîê Z-Plane Visualization and Interaction
- **Interactive Z-Plane Plot**:
  - Unit circle representation.
  - Users can place zeros and poles interactively.

- **Modification Options**:
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for placed zeros/poles.
  - Click-to-delete specific zeros/poles.
  - Clear options: Clear all zeros, all poles, or all elements.
  - Add conjugates for complex elements (optional).
  - Zero-pole swapping feature.
  - Undo/redo for all operations.

### üè¢ Filter Realization and Export
- **Filter Realization**:
  - Direct Form II realization.
  - Cascade form realization.
- **C Code Generation**:
  - Automatically generate C code for the designed filter.

### üé• Frequency Response Visualization
- **Magnitude and Phase Response**:
  - Separate plots for magnitude response and phase response.

### üîí Built-In Filter Library
- Predefined library of 10+ famous digital filters, including:
  - Low-Pass Filters (LPF)
  - High-Pass Filters (HPF)
  - Band-Pass Filters (BPF)
  - Filter Types: Butterworth, Chebyshev, Inverse Chebyshev, Bessel, and Elliptic.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Real-Time Filtering
- **Apply Filter to Real-Time Signal**:
  - Process a lengthy signal (minimum 10,000 points) in real-time.
  - Visualize the time progress of both the input and filtered signals.
- **Custom Signal Input**:
  - Generate signals by moving the mouse within a dedicated area.
  - Mouse speed correlates to signal frequency.
- **Control Temporal Resolution**:
  - Adjustable speed via a slider to process points per second.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Phase Correction with All-Pass Filters
- **All-Pass Filter Library**:
  - Visualize and select from predefined all-pass filters.
  - View zero-pole combinations and phase responses.
- **Custom All-Pass Filter Design**:
  - Define custom ‚Äúa‚Äù coefficients.
  - Integrate custom filters into the library.
- **Enable/Disable All-Pass Filters**:
  - Toggle filters using a drop-down menu or checkbox group.
